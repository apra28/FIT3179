            <h2> Where are NBA Players Born? </h2>
            <p>This maps shows the percentage of NBA players born in each state of the US. Of the over 3000 players in the NBA since 1950, around 2500 are born in America. Of those players, a staggered 11.18% and 9.49% are born in California and New York. These two states make up the birthplaces of one-fifth of the entire league historically! </p>
            <p>This may be due to the strong basketball lineage that both these states possess. California is home to four NBA teams (LA Lakers, LA Clipper, Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings) whilst New York also has two teams (NY Knicks and Brooklyn Nets). Having basketball heavily rooted in the culture of each state inspires local players to represent their hometown at the highest level of competition.</p>

            <h2> Which Colleges Draft the most NBA Players?</h2>
            <p> The University of Kentucky (Kentucky) and the University of California (California) have both drafted 84 NBA players since 1950. We learned in the previous chart that only 2.72% of all historic NBA players are both in Kentucky, yet the university is still able to produce the same volume of players in California.</p>
            <p> This is because the Kentucky Wildcats are the most successful NCAA Division I (main college league) basketball program in history. The number one in all-time wins (2300), winning percentage (0.765) and have 5 NCAA Championships. Their prestigious head coach and development program attracts the best talent from across the state which is a winning combination to produce NBA players. </p>

            <h2> What type of players do the Top Colleges produce? </h2>
            <p>The scatter plot the right plots the profile (weight & height) of all NBA players drafted from the top 10 colleges in the US in terms of total drafted players. The slider below filters for players born on or after the specified birth year. You can also select the college name to filter players from that college. This chart aims to show how certain colleges produce are more likely to produce top levels of players of a particular profile whilst others produce a wide range of players.</p>
            <p>The University of California seems to produce taller players on average compared to other colleges such as St. Johnâ€™s University. These players would typically play in the frontcourt positions such as Forward (F) or Small Forward (SF).</p>

            <h2>What type of players has the best chance to play in the NBA? </h2>
            <p>Statistically speaking, a player between 200-205 cm and weighting between 95-100 kgs has the best chance to play in the NBA.</p>
            <p>Players of this build are in demand in the NBA because on offence they are tall and athletic enough to drive by and shoot over their opponents. On defence, they are heavy enough to stand their ground against larger players with the right length to contest/block shots.</p>

        <h2>Which Colleges produce the most in-demand players?</h2>
        <p> The left axis shows the average draft pick number for players drafted within that college. Since the best and both sought after players are drafted first, the lower this value, the better. The right axis shows total players drafted by the college. The higher this value, the better.</p>
        <p> When a player gets drafted by Ohio State University, they will on average be the 30th pick in the NBA draft which is exceptional. Though the college has only drafted 26 players in total which is much lower than other top colleges. Most impressively, Duke University has drafted a total of 54 players with the average pick being 34. </p>
